#1. In the first query, I used the WHERE statement to filter only internet product names: 

SELECT product_name
FROM products
WHERE product_type = "Internet";

#2. I then queried the data to find the customer ID information of customers who subscribed to high speed internet: 

SELECT customer_id 
FROM customer_subscriptions
WHERE product_id=1;

#3. I used a subquery to find the email addresses of customers who subscribed to products that were Internet product types: 

SELECT email 
FROM customer_subscriptions
WHERE product_id IN (SELECT product_id 
FROM products
WHERE product_type = "Internet");
