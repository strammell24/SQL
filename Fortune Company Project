# In this SQL project, I inserted data, from a Fortune 500 database, into a table. I then queried the data to answer questions about the Fortune 500 companies: 

# First, I used a CASE statment to group the Fortune 500 companies according to the number of employees: 

SELECT company_name, employees,   
CASE 
WHEN employees <= 9999 THEN "Small_sized_company"
WHEN employees <= 99999 THEN "Medium_sized_company"
WHEN employees <= 999999 THEN "Larged_sized_company"
ELSE "Mega_sized_company"
END AS "Company_size"
FROM fortune_companies
ORDER BY employees asc;

# Then, I used the HAVING clause to find out the average revenue of companies based on their industries. I used the GROUP BY statement group the results by industry: 

# Next, I used a logical operator to filter out the companies that had at least 20 paid time off day and healhcare benefits: 

# Lastly, I used an aggregate function to see the top 10 companies that had the longest employee tenures:
