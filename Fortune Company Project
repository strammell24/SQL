# In this SQL project, I inserted data, from a Fortune 500 database, into a table. I then queried the data to answer questions about the Fortune 500 companies: 

# First, I used a CASE statment to group the Fortune 500 companies according to the number of employees: 

SELECT company_name, employees,   
CASE 
WHEN employees <= 9999 THEN "Small_sized_company"
WHEN employees <= 99999 THEN "Medium_sized_company"
WHEN employees <= 999999 THEN "Larged_sized_company"
ELSE "Mega_sized_company"
END AS "Company_size"
FROM fortune_companies
ORDER BY employees asc;

# Then, I used the HAVING clause to filter and see which industry has an average paid time off of at least 20 days: 

SELECT industry, AVG(paid_time_off_days) AS Average_PTO_Days
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY industry
HAVING AVG(paid_time_off_days)>=20;

# Next, I used a logical operator to filter out the top 10 companies that had at least 20 paid time off days and healhcare benefits: 

SELECT company_name, paid_time_off_days, healthcare_benefits
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE paid_time_off_days >=20 
AND healthcare_benefits = 1
ORDER BY paid_time_off_days desc
LIMIT 10;

# Lastly, I used an aggregate function to see the top 10 companies that had the longest employee tenures:
