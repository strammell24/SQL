# In this Netfilx project, I used the Postgre SQL dialect to query data about Netflix films.

#1. I used a left join to join two different tables: 

SELECT Titles.show_id, Titles.type, Titles.title, Titles.date_added
FROM "netflix_titles_info" as Titles 
LEFT JOIN "netflix_people" as People ON Titles.show_id=People.show_id;

#2. I used the COUNT functiont to calculate the number of movie titles in the database: 

SELECT COUNT ("netflix_titles_info".title) 
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE "netflix_titles_info".type = 'Movie';

#3. I then used the MAX function to find the most recent batch of tv shows/movies that were added to the database: 

SELECT MAX(DATE(date_added))
FROM "netflix_titles_info";

#4. Next, I listed all of the movies and tv shows alphabetically:

SELECT title 
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

#5. I used a left join to join two tables to find the director of a film: 

SELECT director
FROM "netflix_people" as People
LEFT JOIN "netflix_titles_info" as Titles
ON People.show_id=Titles.show_id
WHERE title='The Starling';

#6. Lastly, I used aggregate functions to find the oldest movie in the database and when it was made: 

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;
