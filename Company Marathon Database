# In this SQL project, I used mathematical operators to calculated and retrieve data from the table, that contains data about participants in a marathon. 

#1. I used multiplication in SQL to calculate the percentage of the marathan that each parcipant completed: 

SELECT participant_name, 
completion_fraction*100 as percent_completed
FROM marathon; 

#2. I used the ROUND function to calculate the percentage of the marathon completed, to one decimal place, for every participant in the marathon: 

SELECT participant_name, 
ROUND(completion_fraction*100,1) as percent_completed
FROM marathon;

#3. I used ther CASE statement to create a new column that showed the number of employees that completed each quarter of the marathon: 

SELECT COUNT(*) as Number_of_Employees, 
CASE 
WHEN completion_fraction >=.75 THEN "75%+"
WHEN completion_fraction >=.50 THEN "50%+"
WHEN completion_fraction >=.25 THEN "25%+"
ELSE "Under 25%"
END AS "Quarter_completed"
FROM marathon
GROUP BY quarter_completed;
