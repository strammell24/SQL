# In this City Bike Lanes project, I inserted the City Bike Lanes data into a table I created. 
# I then used a CTE to help see which bike lanes were the safest bike lanes based on their ratings being 4.0 or above: 

WITH average_safety_rating_CTE As (
SELECT c. street, 
AVG (c.safetyrating) as  sr
FROM CityBikeLanes as c
GROUP BY c.street)

SELECT street, sr, 'Safe Lane' as tag
FROM average_safety_rating_CTE 
WHERE sr >=4.0
GROUP BY street;
