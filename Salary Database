#1. For the first query, I used the HAVING and GROUP BY statements to show the sum of the salaries for each department in a company where the totals salary spent on each department was $300,000. 

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary_spent
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department
HAVING total_salary_spent>= 300000;

#2. I also used the HAVING and GROUP BY statements to find the average salary for each department that was at least $70,000: 

SELECT department, AVG(salary) As average_salary
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department
HAVING average_salary>=70000;
