# In my Music SQL Project, I used SQL to answer questions about a Digital Media store: 

# 1 What were the total number of sales for 2013?

SELECT SUM (Total ) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31';

#2 What is the invoice total, customer name, and country for all invoices and customers in the United States? 

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.BillingCountry, invoices.total
FROM invoices
JOIN customers 
ON invoices.CustomerId=customers.Customerid
WHERE BillingCountry = 'USA';

#3 What are the total sales made by each sales agent?

SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, Round(Sum(invoices.Total),0)
FROM employees 
JOIN customers ON employees.employeeID=customers.SupportRepid
JOIN invoices ON customers.Customerid=invoices.CustomerId
WHERE employees.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY employees.FirstName;
