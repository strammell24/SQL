# In the SQL code below, I am answering questions about customer and order information

#1 How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';


#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length (orderID) = 6;

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length (order_id) = 6;

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct Product, MIN (price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT SUM(Quantity) * price AS Revenue, product  
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(quantity), product, sum (Quantity) * price AS Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(distinct acctnum), AVG (quantity * price) 
FROM BIT_DB.customers C
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FS
ON C.order_id = FS.orderID
WHERE FS.Quantity > 2
AND length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
