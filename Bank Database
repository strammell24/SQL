#1 I queried data to filter only the names of the products offered by the bank: 

SELECT product_name 
FROM bank_products;

#2 I use the "OR" operator to query the product names that were checking or savings accounts: 

SELECT product_name
FROM bank_products 
WHERE product_type = "Checking" 
OR product_type = "Savings";

#3 I used the WHERE statement and "AND" and "OR" operators to query financial products that have interest rates at least 0.75%: 

SELECT product_name, interest_rate
FROM bank_products 
WHERE product_type = "Savings"
AND interest_rate >= 0.75
AND monthly_fee = 0;
